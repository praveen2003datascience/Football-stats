Welcome to my Power BI portfolio 🚀 
⚽ Football Stats Analysis – Power BI Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a data-driven decision-making system for building a football club named "ultralearnManral".
Since the club is new and does not yet have a team, the goal is to select the right players based on past performance data while working under a limited budget.

Using Power BI, I have created reports and dashboards that provide insights into player performance, affordability, and suitability for the team. These reports will support the management and stakeholders in selecting the best possible squad.

📂 About the Dataset (2021)

1.Dataset contains details of football players, their current clubs, and various performance measures.

2.Metrics include (examples): goals scored, assists, passing accuracy, defensive stats, and overall ratings.

3.Player details also include club, nationality, market value, and position.

4.The dataset enables comparative analysis across players to identify the best fit for the new club.

🎯 Objectives

1.Select 14–16 key players to form the main roster.

2.Identify 18–22 potential players to provide management with multiple hiring options.

3.Ensure player choices are backed by performance data and aligned with the limited budget.

4.Provide stakeholders with interactive Power BI reports for better decision-making.
